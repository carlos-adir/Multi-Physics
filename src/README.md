# Source files

These files are the implementation

### Back-end files - simulation
There are the files made for calculate the problems like:

* ```finiteelement.py``` - Just for import use, integrates the base function
* ```multiphysics.py``` - Just for import use, inside it there are the matrix used
* ```simulation.py``` - To run and make the files ```.npy``` that contains the results that will be used for another use

### Visualize the data that were created
And the files that were made for seeing the results

* ```interface.py``` - Plot a 3D graphs
* ```comparation.py``` - Do the comparation of the differents methods of resolution
* ```animation.py``` - We can see the movement in animation

If you are going to use then, I suggest to run the file ```simulation.py``` and after that the file ```interface.py```
